\section{Soil moisture sensor}
Capacitive soil moisture sensors have two electrodes that form a planar capacitor with soil acting as the dielectric material as shown in figure \ref{fig:capacitor}.

The percentage of water will change the dielectric constant of the soil and therefore the capacitance. The sensor uses a timer to output a PWM voltage proportional to the capacitance of the soil. \cite{moisture_sensor_img}

\section{UV light sensor}
Ultraviolet light has a wavelength range of 100 to 400 nm and can be measured using a photodiode or photo-resistor. These produce either a current or resistance that is dependant on UV radiation. The sensor outputs a voltage proportional to this current or resistance. \cite{UV_sensor}
