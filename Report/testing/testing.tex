\section{UV light exposure and soil moisture level measurement and
logging}

%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Testing procedure}
The logging of the sensor data will be tested by placing the sensors in controlled environments to verify the readings. The sensors and microcontroller will also be placed in a planter for 24 hours to assess the data logging capability of the system.

%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Results}
TO DO: fill in testing results \\
Process 24h data and make graph?
